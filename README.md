# about me 👨‍💻

My name is Manuel Gonzalez, and I currently work with web technologies. Over time, I have come to favor them for their ease of development and well-documented resources. My programming stack consists of MongoDB, Express, Vue.js 3, and Node (MEVN).

I am a very curious person, and I like to understand the reasons behind things. This leads me to research processes and how technologies and tools are used or installed for us programmers.


## about my learning process  📚

 I am currently studying a [course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/), about mobile app development for iOS, as I have an idea for a mobile app that I want to develop (I'll share more about it later). Who knows, maybe in the future, I'll become a professional iOS developer.
